Menu commands are called by there name and a number of options parameters.

The following forms are valid syntax

command without parameters  : menucmd
command with one parameter  : menucmd "xyz"
command with two parameters : menucmd 123, "abc def"
command with two parameters : menucmd(456,"abc")

Most menu commands run without any parameters at all, and most are taken
straight from the main and xfer menus.  Additional commands are added to
manage the menu system as well as a few commands which will help you to
emulate other BBSes.
